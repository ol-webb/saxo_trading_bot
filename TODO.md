## Near Future

0. confirm whether order side and position side are 'buy' / 'sell' / 'long' / 'short'

1. add keyword arguments to all the methods

2. logging, print statements etc



## Further Future

### Robustness

1. unlikely, but we could have multiple outstanding orders for an asset, currently when iterating through "orders" we just pick the first one that matches the ticker. We might have multiple.
